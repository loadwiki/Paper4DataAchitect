# Papers4DataAchitect
## Background
There are so many kinds of distributed data store systems(DDS) and distributed compute systems(DCS) in DT times.
As a application engineer, you may use RDBMS,NoSQL even NewSQL to store data. As a data enginner, you may capture data from app's log and RDBMS even crawl data from web sites and transfer them into ES/hadoop, analyze them in spark/hive.
## Purpose
It is a key ability of data engineer to work efficent with the diverse utility for big data. Obvilously the skill is not so easy to get. The various tools for big data are more complicated and more complex than traditional RDBMS. Sometimes digging into the implemention details of a DDS/DCS may be hard and unnecessary. However,  understanding some common sense of the big data software stack will be a greate help. Different DDS/DPS do have some common concept and design patern. It it a good idea to read the original paper which describles the background,key algorithm,author's consideration about the DDS/DCS. For a data architect, reading these paper is basic work.
This repository will collect and classify these papers especially for Chinese engineer with matter of GFW.
## How to read
Per paper per short comment both in English/Chinese. The comment consist of background description, abstraction, and contrast between similar systems.
